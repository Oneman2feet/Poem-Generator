<b>Our project: </b>

The Poem-Generator will have a better name by Friday.
Our project will generate poems from dictionaries of words, in different poetic forms and themes.  We will generate them and place them on the website.  Users of the website will have a profile where they can see their poems, and a newsfeed where they can see other people's poems and like them.  We might add pictures to the poems, and we might add sharing capabilities for the poems.
